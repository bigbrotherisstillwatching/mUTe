# mUTe

Very simple audioplayer for Ubuntu Touch Focal (because the standard music player is not working properly for me on Fairphone 4)

## Keep in mind that:

- it's an unconfined app    
- releases for arm64 only

## ToDo:

- unfortunately i realized that there's still a lot to do:

  - [ ] skipping behaviour when repeatcurrent is activated
  - [ ] skipping behaviour when repeatall is activated
  - [ ] list behaviour when adding or removing songs
  - [ ] shuffle behaviour when skipping
  - [ ] empty shuffle array when disabling shuffle

  maybe more...
